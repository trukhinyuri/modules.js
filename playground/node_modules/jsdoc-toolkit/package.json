It is written in JavaScript and is run\nfrom a command line (or terminal) using the Node.JS JavaScript runtime\nengine.\n\nUsing this tool you can automatically turn JavaDoc-like comments in\nyour JavaScript source code into published output files, such as HTML\nor XML.\n\nFor more information, to report a bug, or to browse the technical\ndocumentation for this tool please visit the official JsDoc Toolkit\nproject homepage at http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/\n\nFor the most up-to-date documentation on JsDoc Toolkit see the \nofficial wiki at http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/w/list\n\n======================================================================\n\nREQUIREMENTS:\n\nNode.JS interpreter http://nodejs.org\n\n======================================================================\n\nUSAGE:\n\nBefore running the JsDoc Toolkit app you should change your current\nworking directory to the jsdoc-toolkit folder. Then follow the\nexamples below, or as shown on the project wiki.\n\nOn Mac OS X or Linux the command would look like this:\n\n$ app/run.js -a -t=templates/jsdoc mycode.js\n\nThe above assumes your current working directory contains the \"app\"\nand \"templates\" subdirectories from the standard JsDoc Toolkit\ndistribution and that the relative path to the code you wish to\ndocument is \"mycode.js\".\n\nThe output documentation files will be saved to a new directory named\n\"out\" (by default) in the current directory, or if you specify a\n-d=somewhere_else option, to the somewhere_else directory.\n\nFor help (usage notes) enter this on the command line:\n\n$ app/run.js --help\n\nMore information about the various command line options used by JsDoc\nToolkit are available on the project wiki.\n\n======================================================================\n\nTESTING:\n\nTo run the suite of unit tests included with JsDoc Toolkit enter this\non the command line:\n\n$ app/run.js -T\n\nTo see a dump of the internal data structure that JsDoc Toolkit has\nbuilt from your source files use this command:\n\n$ app/run.js mycode.js -Z\n\n======================================================================\n\nLICENSE:\n\nJSDoc.pm\n\nThis project is based on the JSDoc.pm tool, created by Michael\nMathews and Gabriel Reid.
